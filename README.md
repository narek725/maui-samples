# .NET 6.0.0 Client App Samples for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows

_These apps are based on previews of Mobile (iOS/Android) and Desktop (macOS/Windows) in .NET 6 which are **not for production use**. Expect breaking changes as this is still in development for .NET 6._

If you are looking for the absolute newest download links, see the [develop](https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples/tree/develop) branch.

## Installing with .NET MAUI Check Tool

This is a community supported, open source, global dotnet tool intended to help evaluation your development environment and help you install / configure everything you need to build a .NET MAUI application.

Install: `dotnet tool install -g redth.net.maui.check`

Run: `maui-check`

This will evaluate your environment and in most cases optionally install / configure missing components for you, such as:

* OpenJdk / AndroidSDK
* .NET 6 Preview SDK
* .NET MAUI / iOS / Android workloads and packs
* .NET MAUI Templates
* Workload Resolver .sentinel files for dotnet and Visual Studio Windows/Mac
* Currently does not install workloads required for WinUI3

For more information and source code, visit [redth/dotnet-maui-check](https://github.com/redth/dotnet-maui-check)

## .NET 6 Preview Installers

If you prefer to install everything manually, you can find all of the official installer links below:

* Windows: [dotnet-sdk-6.0.100-preview.4.21255.9-win-x64.exe](https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/6.0.100-preview.4.21255.9/dotnet-sdk-6.0.100-preview.4.21255.9-win-x64.exe)
* macOS: [dotnet-sdk-6.0.100-preview.4.21255.9-osx-x64.pkg](https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/6.0.100-preview.4.21255.9/dotnet-sdk-6.0.100-preview.4.21255.9-osx-x64.pkg)

_NOTE: newer builds of .NET *may* work, but your mileage may vary.
You can find the full list of builds at the [dotnet/installer][dotnet/installer] repo._

## `dotnet workload install` Command

Starting in .NET 6 Preview 4, a new `dotnet workload install` command
is available for installing the mobile workloads. You will need to run
this command in the current directory of this repository, so the
`NuGet.config` file will be used.

> NOTE: The `--configfile` and `--add-source` switches are not
> implemented yet for `dotnet workload install` in .NET 6 Preview 4.

On Windows, in an Administrator command prompt:

    > cd C:\src\maui-samples
    > dotnet workload install microsoft-android-sdk-full --skip-manifest-update

On macOS, you'd need to use `sudo`:

    $ cd ~/src/maui-samples
    $ sudo dotnet workload install microsoft-android-sdk-full --skip-manifest-update

The path to the `NuGet.config` file should be the file found in this repo.

The workload ID for each platform is:

* `microsoft-android-sdk-full`
* `microsoft-ios-sdk-full`
* `microsoft-maccatalyst-sdk-full`
* `microsoft-macos-sdk-full`
* `microsoft-tvos-sdk-full`

> NOTE: using `maui-check` is the preferred method for installing
> workloads, because it will check your system for other software. In
> .NET 6 > Preview 4, `maui-check` also will install newer builds for
> Apple platforms that contain additional fixes.

## Projects

* HelloMaui - a multi-targeted .NET MAUI Single Project for iOS and Android
* HelloAndroid - a native Android application
* HelloiOS - a native iOS application
* HelloMacCatalyst - a native Mac Catalyst application
* HelloWinUI3 - .NET MAUI WinUI3 application. WinUI3 requires build and deploy with the latest preview of Visual Studio 2019 16.10

[dotnet/installer]: https://github.com/dotnet/installer#installers-and-binaries

## Android

Prerequisites:

* Starting in .NET 6 Preview 4, [Microsoft OpenJDK 11](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) is recommended.
* You will need the Android SDK installed as well as `Android SDK Platform 30`. Simplest way to get this is to install the current Xamarin workload and go to `Tools > Android > Android SDK Manager` from within Visual Studio.

For example, to build the Android project:

    dotnet build HelloAndroid

You can launch the Android project to an attached emulator or device via:

    dotnet build HelloAndroid -t:Run

## iOS

Prerequisites:

* Xcode 12.5. Earlier versions won't work.

To build the iOS project:

    dotnet build HelloiOS

To launch the iOS project on a simulator:

    dotnet build HelloiOS -t:Run

## WinUI3

Currently WinUI3 requires build and deploy. You will need to open the HelloWinUI3.sln with the latest preview of Visual Studio 2019 16.10.

* Windows: [Get started with Project Reunion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/project-reunion/get-started-with-project-reunion#set-up-your-development-environment)

## .NET MAUI

To launch the .NET MAUI project, you will need to specify a `$(TargetFramework)` via the `-f` switch:

    dotnet build HelloMaui -t:Run -f net6.0-android
    dotnet build HelloMaui -t:Run -f net6.0-ios
    dotnet build HelloMaui -t:Run -f net6.0-maccatalyst

## Using IDEs

IDE integration into Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, and Visual Studio Code are a work in progress. 

### Visual Studio

Currently, you can use Visual Studio 2019 16.10 on Windows (with the
Xamarin workload installed). .NET 6 Preview 4 requires MSBuild 16.10,
so .NET 6 projects will not be able to load in older versions of
Visual Studio.

### Visual Studio for Mac

Visual Studio for Mac is not supported at this time, but will be coming in a future release.

### iOS from Visual Studio

To build and debug .NET 6 iOS applications from Visual Studio 2019 you must manually intall the .NET 6 SDK and iOS workloads on both **Windows and macOS** (Mac build host).

If while connecting Visual Studio to your Mac through XMA you are prompted to install a different version of the SDK, you can ignore that since it refers to the legacy one.

> Note: currently only the iOS simulator is supported (not the remoted simulator).

### Mac Catalyst from Visual Studio for Mac

Running and debugging apps from Visual Studio for Mac is not supported at this time..

### Known Issues - Visual Studio & Visual Studio for Mac

* There are no project property pages available for both iOS and Android
* Editors (i.e. Manifest editor, Entitlements editor, etc.) will fail to open, so as a workaround please open those files with the XML editor.

### Visual Studio Code

Support has been added to allow debugging of **Android** based apps in Visual Studio Code. Open the `net6-mobile-samples.code-workspace` in Visual Studio Code.

    > code net6-mobile-samples.code-workspace

To build your application use open the Command Pallette and select `Run Build Task`. Select `Build` and then the `Target` you want to run. Available targets are:

* `Build` : Builds the Project.
* `Install` : Installs the Application on a Device or Emulator.
* `Clean` : Clean the Project.

You can then select the `Project` and then the `Configuration` (`Debug` or `Release`) you want to `Build`.

To Debug goto the `Run` Tab and make sure `Debug` is selected. Click the Run button. You will be prompted on which project you wish to run, then asked which `TargetFramework` you want to target. For now only `net6.0-android` is supported. You will then be asked if you want to attach the debugger. Finally you will be asked which configuration you wish to use `Debug` or `Release`. After this the application should deploy and run, breakpoints should behave as normal.
